        <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p>Please join us in beautiful Maastricht this June for the “Networks in Science of Science” workshop, a satellite of NetSci25.
		We invite researchers and practitioners to share their work on the use of network approaches applied to studies in science of science.
		We particularly encourage submissions from <strong>junior researchers</strong>, including graduate students, postdocs, and pre-tenure professors.
		We will award a <strong>Best Student Paper Award</strong>, recognizing the best submission led by a graduate student(s).
		We will host a <strong>networking lunch</strong> following the morning workshop.</p>
        
    </section>

    

    <section id="submission">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>We welcome submissions that explore the use of network approaches applied to studies in science of science.
		This includes (but is not limited to): <strong>the analyses of relevant network data</strong> (e.g., citation networks, collaboration networks, semantic networks,
		knowledge graphs), <strong>development of novel methods for science of science applications</strong> (e.g., graph embedding, link prediction), 
		and <strong>experimentations with representations</strong> (e.g., hypergraph, multilayer graph). In addition, we seek submissions in the developing
		areas of exploration concerned with the <strong>impact of diverse voices and intellectual backgrounds, political policies, 
		and intelligences </strong>(including Artificial Intelligence) on scientific advancements.</p>
        <p>The theme of submission this year is <strong>“Science and Society</strong>.” 
		Submissions closer to the theme will be particularly welcome. The program committee
		will review the abstracts for the acceptance as either a contributed talk or a lightning
		talk in the spring. The Best Student Paper Award will be voted on at the workshop by the 
		audience. Submissions cannot be those presented orally at other sessions in NetSci.</p>
		<p>This workshop does not have archival proceedings. Therefore, submissions can be:
		<ul>
            <li>recently published (2024-2025)</li>
            <li>under peer review (e.g. papers published on arxiv or SSRN)</li>
            <li>works in progress</li>
        </ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Submission Format</h2>
		<p>Option 1: Submit a PDF file of your publication or preprint. This option requires minimal work and is suitable for authors having no copyright
		restrictions or other concerns that prevent them from uploading their paper/preprint to a different site.</p>
		<p>Option 2: An abstract. The file should be a PDF. We suggest 1 to 3 pages with unlimited pages
		for references and figures, but you are free to go beyond 3 pages. You can use any template of your choice.</p>
		<h2>Submission Portal</h2>
		<p>Enter your submission on <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=netscisci2025/">EasyChair </a>.
		The portal and any updates to CFP can be found on the workshop website:<a href="https://netsci2025.github.io/cfp/">https://netsci2025.github.io/cfp/</a></p>
		
		<h2>Important Dates</h2>
		<p>We will conduct two rounds of submissions.
		If you want to take advantage of NetSci’s early bird registration rate, please submit to Round 1, 
		and we will let you know our decision by February 21, 2025.</p>
		
		<p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>January 7</strong>: Call for abstracts is released</li>
    <li><strong>February 7</strong>: Round 1 deadline</li>
    <li><strong>February 21</strong>: Round 1 acceptance notice</li>
    <li><strong>February 24</strong>: Deadline for early bird registration rate (-€100 from the regular rate, <a href="https://netsci2025.github.io/registration/">https://netsci2025.github.io/registration/</a>)</li>
    <li><strong>March 15</strong>: Round 2 deadline (contingent on the number of accepted papers from Round 1) <strong>March 29</strong>: Round 2 acceptance notice</li>
